	<p class="p">Jung Ho-yeon (Korean: 정호연; born June 23, 1994), also known as Hoyeon Jung, is a South Korean model and actress. She began her career as a freelance model in 2010, walking in Seoul Fashion Week shows for two years. In 2013, she competed on the fourth season of Korea's Next Top Model and placed as a runner-up. She became known for her "fiery" red hair after making her international runway debut during New York Fashion Week. She was a Louis Vuitton exclusive in 2016, and became a global ambassador for the brand in 2021.</p>

<p class="p">Jung made her acting debut in 2021, starring in the Netflix series Squid Game as Kang Sae-byeok, which brought her worldwide attention and critical acclaim as the series' breakout star. For her role on the series, she won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series and earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Drama Series.</p>

<p class="p">Jung started taking modeling classes at age 15, and began working as a freelance model in 2010 at age 16, walking in shows for Seoul Fashion Week without an agency for two years. While freelancing, she auditioned for the second season of the OnStyle reality competition series Korea's Next Top Model Season 2 in 2011, but quit after making it into the top 30. She signed with ESteem Models in 2012 and went on to compete on the fourth season of Korea's Next Top Model in 2013, where she placed as a runner-up. She appeared in the music video for Kim Yeon-woo's song "Move" in 2014. She was also featured in spreads for the Korean editions of magazines such as Vogue, Elle, and W before signing with The Society Management and leaving South Korea in 2016 to pursue a career overseas. She also signed to Elite Model Management and Nomad Management. Before moving to New York, Jung inadvertently dyed her hair a "fiery" red color, which became her signature look.	</p>
